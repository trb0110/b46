#### Status: Experimental

## Summary

-------

The genesis of sniping bots exemplifies the market's ability to self-regulate in a dynamic and fast paced environment.
Over the years, the web3 and chain space has garnered a tremendous amount of attention driven by several factors,
some of which simple and others complex. 

This project represents my exploration of human and behavioral transaction patterns through the command line.
I have decided to venture on this experimental journey as a mode of discovery.

This program is my interpretation of a transactions sniper in a crazed market. 

The program is written in go for personal preference.
